        <strong>Nitansha</strong> an independent <strong>artist (singer)</strong>
        based in Karnal recently released her first song with her brother <strong>Dhruvansh (BaddMint)</strong>
        who directed the musical composition. Nitansha sang the song, also she wrote it (kind of obvious, I know!)
        What she was looking for was a visual representation of how it would look on your favorite streaming platforms (How it sounded was beyond words!).
        I worked with her on several versions of the <strong>cover</strong> until we finally got to the cover of <strong>Mess It Up</strong>
