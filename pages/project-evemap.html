            One fine day Charul (friend of mine) and I were relaxing at our
            university so we came up with an idea and did some research but it didn't work
            out so we thought of another <strong>idea</strong>. This idea would be a fusion
            of tinder-like features and an event-driven atmosphere. Basically, it was about networking
            people with similar regional interests at events and thus finding like-minded
            people for an event to attend to. Unfortunately, this idea did not come true
            and it still in the construction phase. During the development phase, we thought of
            <strong>an application</strong> for the idea (also a website).
        </p>

            I had studied <strong>UI/UX</strong> so I started working on developing
            <strong>wireframes</strong> for the application. After developing these wireframes, I worked
            on screen <strong>mockups</strong> for the app.

            When you don't have somebody to accompany you to an event and want
            someone who shares your enthusiasm for the event. So what exactly do you do?
            You don't go or go alone, obviously.
            <stong>EVE MAP</stong> is here to help with that. Connecting you with individuals
            who share your interests in events so that you don't miss out on your favorite events or
            go alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea for the <strong>EVE MAP app</strong> came from conducting extensive <strong>research</strong>
            into the target demographic and repeating the <strong>wireframes</strong> to gain a better grasp
            of how to create a <strong>workflow</strong> for the app. To provide a rich
            <strong>experience</strong> for the audience (i.e. mainly college students between 20-30 years of age).
            I tried to keep it as minimal and easy as possible.
